      The Active learning for Systematic Reviews (ASReview)
      project implements learning algorithms that interactively
      query the researcher. This way of interactive training is
      known as Active Learning. ASReview offers support for
      classical learning algorithms and state-of-the-art
      learning algorithms like neural networks. ASReview LAB is
      the graphical user interface of the open-source research
      software and ships with an Oracle, Exploration, and
      Simulation Mode.
